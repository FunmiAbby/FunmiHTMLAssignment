<font size="5" face="arial" color="white"</font>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest achiever is not a person
who does'nt have a Future, but a person who is focused and determined can be an Achiever 
because an Adage says "The best Achiever of the Life are the best Conquerors of Pains and Misfortune"
So with this I thank God for giving me the grace to be an Achiever, though I faced a lot of challenges
before becoming an Achiever because an adage says" If you fail to plan, you will plan to fail" and I 
also give thanks to my parent for their support over me in becoming an achiever. 
I give glory to Almighty God for giving me the grace to be an Achiever.I will be so glad to reveal some
of my Achievement to you:<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly I become an Achiever academically
through  alot of things and sacrificing some things to ensure am an achiever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some of them are not sleeping at night, not
sleeping at appropriate time just to be able to achieve my goal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes i will like to rest but i will have 
to gather my energy and do some assignments and some work i need to do,also waking up early just to make sure
i get to school early at the appropriate time.even under the huge sun i will be in school learning and reading even
when the brain need rest i will be busy with my books just to make sure i become an achiever academically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am an achiever spiritually through a lot of prayers and
fasting and devotion, i devoted myself to most things such as reading the bible,praying and helping those who are
in need of help in which most times is not an easy task.<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sacrifice a lot in my secret place just to ensure there
is an increase in my spiritual life. "I get an understanding that the more sacrifice you make in your secret place the
more increasement in your spiritual life".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion i give God the glory for howfar he has 
helped me."Note to become an achiever is not an easy task you need to be deteremined and work harder".<brs>
